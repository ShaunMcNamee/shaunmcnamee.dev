<p style="font-size: 16px"><span style="font-weight: 600">Project - </span>The project I am working on at PwC is a risk assessment application for banks and other financial institutions. It helps them configure questions about their risks and have their employees answer those questions on assessments to find where they are vulnerable to fraud, sanctions, and money laundering</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px"><span style="font-weight: 600">Team - </span>The team is entirely remote and made up of 13 developers from around the US. It skews towards more development experience, but we do have some early career devs doing great work.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px"><span style="font-weight: 600">Stack - </span>This application uses Node, React, and ArangoDB. We are currently transitioning to TypeScript for both client and server. Our applications are in a Lerna monorepo and we use GitHub and Jenkins for source control and CI/CD. The application is hosted on AWS.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px"><span style="font-weight: 600">My Role - </span>As I am one of the more senior developers on the team, my role is frequently help turn parts other developers create into a whole application. I spend significant time creating useful abstractions to make everyone else's development speedier. I helped create many of the components in our shared component library, and I also spend my time working through some of the harder issues in the application (especially the client-side).</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px">This is a contract position that is currently running through June 2020.</p>
