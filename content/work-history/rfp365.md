<p style="font-size: 16px">At RFP365, we used Java and jQuery to maintain an RFP tracking system in use by many of the local governments. I introduced the team to React, which we used to port the application. I also helped transition the application to Spring Boot - greatly simplifying the server side.</p> 
<p style="font-size: 16px">I mentored junior developers on the team, as well as spearheading the introduction of Learning Fridays - we used a few hours each Friday to watch a new online course or try out a new language / framework.</p>
