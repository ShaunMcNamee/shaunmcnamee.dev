<p style="font-size: 16px"><span style="font-weight: 600">Project - </span>At RFP365 I worked on an RFP tracking application. It allowed users to write answers to questions, track the status of the RFP, and reuse answers from previous RFPs. It was in use by many local governments.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px"><span style="font-weight: 600">Team - </span>When I started, I was only the third developer (the others were an intern and the co-founder). I helped us bring on two more while I was there as well as mentor the intern into a junior developer position.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px"><span style="font-weight: 600">Stack - </span>When I started, it was a Java and jQuery web application. I worked to transform the client side into React, which was mostly in place when I left. It was hosted on AWS with a mySQL database.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px"><span style="font-weight: 600">My Role - </span>I was brought in specifically because of my experience with Java/React. The application was starting to show some cracks as a startup MVP, and the co-founder knew that some changes would be needed to scale this out.</p>
