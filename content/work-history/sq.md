<p style="font-size: 16px"><span style="font-weight: 600">Project - </span>The project at SelectQuote was an internal tool for the sales team to track the status of leads. It required hooking up to many third party APIs and need to present the user with a lot of useful information at the right times.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px"><span style="font-weight: 600">Team - </span>The team was mostly senior developers with a few juniors sprinkled in when some of the seniors got poached. While I was there, we had between 10-15 developers at any time. We worked 3 days a week in the office and 2 at home.</p>

We used a hosted mariaDB on AWS for our database. Bitbucket with bitbucket pipelines was our source control and CI/CD.</p>
