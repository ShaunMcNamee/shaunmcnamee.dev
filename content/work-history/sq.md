<p style="font-size: 16px">At SelectQuote, we used Node and React to create the next version of an internal tool for sales agents. It involved loading sales leads, keeping track of the state of a lead, and providing timely, pertinent information to the sales agent and sales managers.</p> 
<p style="font-size: 16px">I lead the team that was in charge of moving our applications from on premises servers to AWS. I also was involved in interviewing new candidates, as well as mentoring junior developers.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px">This position was 1/2 time remote for those that lived nearby; we also had a few fully remote employees and contractors that I worked with while I was there.</p>
