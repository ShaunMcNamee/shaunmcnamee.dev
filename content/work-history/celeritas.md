<p style="font-size: 16px">At Celeritas Technologies, we used Java / Javascript / Oracle to maintain a suite of web applications around oil & gas pipeline regulation. My team helped transition some of the database layer to MongoDB, as well as adding new AngularJS client side applications. We fixed bugs, wrote documentation, and did QA and deployment.</p>
