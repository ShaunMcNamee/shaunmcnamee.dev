<p style="font-size: 16px"><span style="font-weight: 600">Project - </span>We created and maintained a suite of web applications around oil & gas pipeline regulation. There were two major ones - one was for tracking one-call dig tickets and the other for tracking public awareness (mailings, meetings, etc.).</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px"><span style="font-weight: 600">Team - </span>I was one of 5 developers on the team - we had a range of skills and experience. We were responsible for design, development, QA, and deployment.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px"><span style="font-weight: 600">Stack - </span>We used Java and jQuery for the application and hosted it on our own Oracle servers. We had some data in an Oracle DB and other data in MongoDB. Near the end of my time there, we were transitioning the client side to AngularJS.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px"><span style="font-weight: 600">My Role - </span> I was junior when I started here, but after a few years I was put in charge of skunk-works projects (one of which turned into our AngularJS client side switch). I also headed up the QA for many of ou releases.</p>
