<p>Right now, this barely has any features at all. The goal is to use it to plan the meals for my family every week by choosing from recipes I have entered, then get a list of groceries I need added to my Todoist.</p>

<p>This is straight from create-react-app with a Hasura graphQL Database server. It is deployed using Netlify. The UI is with Chakra and the forms use Formik.</p>
